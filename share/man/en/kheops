.SH DESCRIPTION
kheops is a simulator for neural networks described in XML graph structures designed by Papyrus software.
kheops is designed to be used in online environnement, mainly to design robotics controller.
kheops uses dataflow paradigm to process the neural network, is strongly typed and uses Eigen3 library for linear algebra.
kheops is based on ROS communication tools to stream data (get sensors data and send motor orders) and to communicate throw some kheops instances.

.SH RUN WITH ROS 

kheops need ROS to be fully functionnal (Input/Output, IPC). 
You need to run ROS before running kheops.

$ roscore

$ rosrun kheops kheops
